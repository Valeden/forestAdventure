            A rugged man, armed with a spear and shield in his hands, a sword at his hip. He takes sight of you and his stance changes. Before you can get open your mouth to speak, he charges! You move your arms to ready a weapon...

        <a class="option" href="loss.html">You ready your bow and begin firing at the charging warrior!</a>
        <p>or</p>
        <a class="option" href="sword.html">You ready your sword and shield, defending against the charge!</a>
