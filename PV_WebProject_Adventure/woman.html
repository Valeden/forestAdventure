            A beautiful woman, draped in delicate fabrics. As she sits along a pond and you approach her. She speaks softly, "Hail traveler, could you spare a few coins?" It seems rather odd for her to ask a stranger in the forest for gold...
        </p>
        <a class="option" href="give.html">You accept her request, seeing no harm in losing a bit of gold.</a>
        <p>or</p>
        <a class="option" href="loss.html">You refuse her request, keeping your distance from the suspicous woman.</a>

        <a class="return" href="index.html">Return to the beginning of a new adventure.</a>
