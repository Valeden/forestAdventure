            The man's spear strikes your sheild, and the force staggers you both. You counter attack with your sword, an overhead blow. The man raises his sheild to block and stabs forward with his spear. You sidestep the attack and move in close to land a stab of your own, your shortsword much better suited for combat this close. The attack was a critical hit, the man goes down in an instant. You've won this encounter.
